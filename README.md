# Simple examples for H2O and PH3

Run with Gaussian09. View this with Avogadro or GaussView
## H2O (water)
Ran a MO calculation with a very tiny basis set (not recommended in practice).
To view the MO's: 
```
avogadro h2o/h2o_opt_freq.fchk
```

## PH3 (phosphine)

Ran a frequency calculation with a very tiny basis set (not recommended in practice).
To view the vibrations: 
```
avogadro ph3/ph3.log 
```
